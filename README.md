# Five-Function-Calculator
I will come back to this at a later time once I have more experience in C++ to fix this silly issue, but for now this functions as intended save for one thing - if you go into trace logic, and see all of the
decisions made, it functions as intended. However, once you go back to the calculator you will see the remains of the window holding that text, and if there was text in it you will also see that.

Otherwise, functions as I intended; a five-function calculator that will do all computations correctly, no matter given the number. It will also reset after you hit the equal, so that you don't continue adding to 
the previous result, since that would be counter-intuitive for the user. The % is an additive tax, which can be used with multiple numbers but is typically only used with a + operator, as it will add
the % of that previous number. Intro trace on will turn on the introspective trace for the trace logic tab to actually function.. If you decide you don't care for that, it is disabled by default. If you do turn it
on, you can additionally turn it right back off with the trace off button.
